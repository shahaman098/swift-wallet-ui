# @circle-fin/adapter-viem-v2

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Improves static gas estimate values for contract calls. Updates adapters' `prepare()` method so that transaction simulation is now performed only during `execute()`, not during `estimate()`. Adds an optional fallback parameter to `estimate()` for cases where gas estimation fails.

### Patch Changes

- Fix CommonJS compatibility by correcting file extensions and package exports. This resolves a "ReferenceError: require is not defined" error that occurred when using packages in CommonJS projects with ts-node.

- Fixes an important bug affecting developer-controlled adapter scenarios (such as when using Fireblocks or Circle Wallets). Previously, these adapters would mistakenly attempt to use the connected wallet's account during contract execution, which could cause failures if no user wallet was connected. With this update, developer-controlled adapters now correctly use the address specified in your operation (as a JSON-RPC account), ensuring API-based signing services work as intended. User-controlled adapters continue to use the connected wallet account as before. If you use programmatic signing (such as MPC or custody APIs), this update resolves issues with transaction execution and integration with non-wallet-based flows.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add support for Arc Testnet chain definition. Arc is Circle's EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain designed for stablecoin finance and asset
  tokenization, featuring USDC as the native gas token and sub-second finality via the Malachite BFT consensus engine.
- Improve error messages for developer-controlled address contexts. Calling `getAddress()` on an adapter configured with `addressContext: 'developer-controlled'` now throws a clear error explaining that addresses must be provided explicitly in the operation context.
- Update Sonic Testnet chain definition to canonical network. The `SonicTestnet` chain definition now points to the official Sonic Testnet (chainId: 14601) instead of the deprecated Sonic Blaze Testnet (chainId: 57054). The RPC endpoint has been updated to `https://rpc.testnet.soniclabs.com`, the display name simplified to "Sonic Testnet", and the USDC contract address updated to the new deployment.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - **Chain ID:** 57054 → 14601
  - **RPC Endpoint:** `https://rpc.blaze.soniclabs.com` → `https://rpc.testnet.soniclabs.com`
  - **USDC Address:** `0xA4879Fed32Ecbef99399e5cbC247E533421C4eC6` → `0x0BA304580ee7c9a980CF72e55f5Ed2E9fd30Bc51`

  **Migration:** If you were using `SonicTestnet`, your application will automatically connect to the new network upon upgrading. Any accounts, contracts, or transactions on the old Blaze testnet (chainId: 57054) will need to be recreated on the new testnet.
